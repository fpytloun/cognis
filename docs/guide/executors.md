# Executors

Executors are the part of Cognis that perform tool execution. The controller decides what should happen; executors are the hands that actually run tools.

![Controller and executor split](../assets/images/cognis-controller-executor-split.svg)

## Why executors exist

This separation lets Cognis:

- keep orchestration logic in one place
- isolate tool execution
- connect to remote machines when tools need local access
- optionally route model inference through a matching executor

## Executor modes

Depending on configuration, Cognis can use:

- in-process executors for simple local setups
- subprocess executors for local isolation
- remote WebSocket executors for user-local or multi-machine deployments

For multi-user production setups, remote executors are the preferred model.

## What executors control

Executors define the effective tool pool available to agents. Agents inherit tools from their executor and can then further limit categories, individual tools, and permission policy.

Executors can also be used to:

- attach MCP servers
- expose only selected tool groups
- host channel adapters that need local services
- route provider calls to executor-side inference when supported

## Where to manage executors

Open `Settings` and use the executors section to inspect:

- configured executors
- status and health
- enabled tool groups
- individually enabled tools
- attached MCP servers

## Choosing the right mode

- Use local executor modes for development and simple single-user setups.
- Use remote WebSocket executors when tools, channels, or model endpoints must stay on another machine.
- Disable local executor modes in shared production environments if the controller should not execute tools locally.

## Common troubleshooting checks

- verify the executor is connected
- confirm the required tools are enabled on the executor
- confirm the agent is bound to the expected executor or label selector
- confirm any required secrets or MCP servers are assigned correctly
